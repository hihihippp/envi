==================
 Envi "is not vi"
==================

> Envi will be a web-based collaborative editor built with the following 4 principles in mind:

- `distributed`   : you can edit files from any of the computer running envi you have access to
- `no mouse`      : envi aim at being as close as possible to command-line based
- `open-source`   : envi local server as well as synchronization servers will be entirely opensource
- `collaborative` : you can see what your team mates are working on realtime


> Envi will be made of:
- `envi-srv`  : a local server running on each machine you want to edit from 
- `envi-sync` : a synchronization server for WLAN accessibility, access-control and realtime collaboration.
- `envi`      : a local executable letting you open local files in your browser from the command-line


> Envi will be based on:
- `ace`    : the web-based editor built for c9 IDE
- `nodeJS`


> Envi will be vi-based (? what do you think)
